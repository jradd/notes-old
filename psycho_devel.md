Notes of Nascency and observations or conceptual ideas

When listing a few options of what you would like your child to do, it is
proven to be most effective if you list the desired option last.


identities  are nested in self-concepts, which make up part of the selfs
reflexive capacity to think, to be aware of one's thinking, and to take oneself
as the object of thinking.

Motivation increases with experienced difficulty if difficulty is understood as meaning that the identity is important and decreases with experienced difficulty.


Sometimes  working  on  one’s  school-focused  future
identities  feels  easy,  but  often  this  is  not  the  case. 
 Even imagining  oneself  doing  what  it  takes  -->  setting  an  earlier
alarm,  staying  still  to  study  more  rather  than  turn  to
something  else  can  feel  difficult.

 How  are  these  metacognitive  experiences  to be  interpreted? 

 Identity-based  motivation  theory  predicts  that  either  ease  or  difficulty  can  motivate  sustained
action  depending  on  the  accessible  lay  theory  of  what  ease
or  difficulty  mean.  Consider  difficulty.  If  working  on  one’s
school-focused  identities is experienced as hard, does this mean that the goal
is important ("no pain, no gain"),
 or does it mean that the goal is impossible to attain for people like oneself?
 
 IBM theory predicts that both interpretations of difficulty are possible and which comes to mind depends on which identity comes to mind and what it means in context.
 
		..future self psychologically connected to present self.
 
 Children with savings  accounts are more liekly to experience this connection because savingsis a current action that benefits the future self. In the same vein, assets matter because they allow children to experience everyday lives in which focus is on the future rather than on attaining sufficient funds to cover present needs.
 
 The  savings  themselves
are  too  small  to  actually  fund  college,  but  taking  action
now  for  a  future  self  by  saving  for  the  future  matters.
Future  research  is  needed  to  understand  the  effect.  For
example,  the  effect  may  be  due  to  dynamic  construction  of
identity  as  someone  who  is  participating  in  the  world
beyond  one’s  immediate  neighborhood.  Alternatively,  the
effect  may  be  due  to  an  increased  sense  that  the  future  is
near,  resulting  in  more  time  spent  on  homework  or  other
school  activities,  or  it  may  be  due  to  change  in  interpretation  of  difficulty  (saving  is  hard  but  the  future  is  important)
which  carries  over  to  persistence  in  school  tasks.


saving money may provide a concretization of the idea that the present is connected to the future, that what one does now matters
for teh future self.
