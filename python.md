# Python Notes
Notes on Python v2.7 and v3.x

#### Libraries
* Math
    fractions, random, numbers, math, cmath

###### Data Types
* Arithmetic:
    +, -, *, **, /, //, %
* Bit-wise:
    <<, >>, &, |, ^, ~
* Comparison:
    <, >, <=, >=,==, !=


### Slices
[START:STOP:STEP]

"word"[::-1] == 'drow'

## Strings
Parsing strings into substrings:

'01.03.05.15'.split('.') to create the sequence ['01', '03', '05', '15']
by splitting on the '.' character.

join() is the inverse of split()

***Not to be used with filenames/paths, use `os.path` instead***
